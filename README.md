eutils: Essential utilities for electron microscopy
======

`eutils` is a group of utilities for dealing with electrons in real and reciprocal space.
It's intended to be very light and stable, while making repetitive tasks simpler.

Features currently include:
 - Essential physical constants
 - Physical properties of relativistic electrons (wavelength, energy, momentum, etc.)
 - Real and reciprocal sampling grids
